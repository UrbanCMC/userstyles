# Userstyles

This repository is a collection of userstyles I created, mostly to create a Dark Mode for websites I visit.
This document will name each of those userstyles and provide a link to install them.

## Requirements
To install and use these styles you'll need a CSS customization add-on for your browser. If you don't have one already, I'd recommend [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), which works with both Chromium and Firefox.
